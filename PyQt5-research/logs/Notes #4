From the following code, the same trick but with new syntax are found here.


the windowTitleChanged.connect(self.function) is a new feature that I have'nt seen it before. 
this syntax shows what should happen in case the window's title name got changed. It's pretty rare syntax to be used in the PyQt5. 

This is written in the doc,
-  Firstly, the windowTitleChanged signal is not always emitted when setting the window title. The signal only fires if they new title is a change from the previous one. Itâ€™s important to know exactly what conditions signals fire under, to avoid being surprised!
