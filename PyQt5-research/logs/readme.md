# Welcome to the logs

Typically this is like the bookshelf of all the research data that I gathered from the PyQt5 and by using other tutorial references. 

I did wrote a couple of logs but as of 8th July,2022 most of the logs are limited due to the fact that I don't really need to create a new file every time i create a new file to work on.

therefore, you will find the logs that include like special important module notes and stuff.

thanks!
