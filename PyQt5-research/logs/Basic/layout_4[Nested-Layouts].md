This is how to create a new nested widget design.


# Start


The first step is to import a lot of submodules of the PyQt5. It includes, Qt, QApplication, QHBoxLayout and so on and so forth.


the layout_colorwidget is imported.

the app is simply 3 layouts into a single widget.
after wards, assign them into a single layout to make them be stacken up. the next step would to be join the layout into a widget and make that widget be the central widget. After that, the magic is done. 



note that you can use the methods of .setContenMargins to configure the layout spacing and you can use the .setSpacing to configure the spacing between .setSpacing.


I recommend to navigate to Basic/layout_4/layout_4.py (2022) to see the result.
