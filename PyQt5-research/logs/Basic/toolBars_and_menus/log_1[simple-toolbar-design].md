The toolBar is a common and a must have for applications that tend to have more than a single feature. 

the code of the tutorial never even mentioned the modules and the import codes and the exec either. possibly because at this point, it is clear that I have already learned how to import them.

the first step is to create a new label located in the center of the app. This is done using the Qt.AlignCenter. it means that this requires the Qt modules. 

the next step is that the toolbar needs to be edited and modified and afterwards, it is added by using addToolBar.


after that, the work is done. 
 
the toolbar can also be turned off. it is done by clicking the toolbar by using the right click and then uncheck the toolbar. If you remove a toolbar, then there is no other way to bring it back again.

please note that the label is the central widget.
