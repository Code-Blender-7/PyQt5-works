# START


The Grid Layout is divided into rows and columns. The structure would be sometime like this -


```

-------------------------
| 0,0 | 0,1 | 0,2 | 0,3 |
| 1,0 | 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3 |
| 2,0 | 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3 |
| 3,0 | 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3 |
-------------------------


```


The above structure is the method formula of changing the colors of the QGridLayout. This is quite easy. The code is much simplier than the nested layers. I wonder if you can show the gridlines here.
