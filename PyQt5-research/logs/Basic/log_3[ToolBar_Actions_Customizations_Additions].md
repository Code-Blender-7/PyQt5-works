The recent study of the PyQt5 includes the usage of the ToolBar module to another level. the scope of its features are actually beyond my expectations. Well, you can say that I am surprised that you can really do all these stuff in this kind of library. let's get started.

### ToolBars and Separators

ToolBars are like the backbone of the navigations and it most of the usage from the user's interference. the ToolBar is as said is taken from the QToolBar module. the task included to create an action button and then link it to respond to the statustip of the application.

the following study includes that the button action doesn't need to be clicked to run the definition of changing the statusTip. it appears that if the mouse hovers over the button action then the responds of the library would be false. if it has a setClickable set to True then it will be True if clicked. Either way, the hover reaction is like an overdo.

the addSeperator() is used to create a new kind of toolBar action bar after the another. it is something like systematic but ok. the QAction module of QIcon can set the type of picture for the action bar. you could also add like a statustip if the mouse hovers over it.

### Menus and SubMenues

The menusbar is like the toolbar only that it is located on the top edge of the application. the menubar is compossed of the same action bars like the toolbars. you could say that their method of adding actionBars are identical. 

To get the menuBar working, be sure to add that from the QtWidgets. The advantage of this MenuBar is that the possibilities are immerse while it makes little crowded on the User interference. you can even add submenus to the menubar. it is just like menuBar added on another menuBar. the menuBar can use seperator to separate the action bars for catagorizations.
