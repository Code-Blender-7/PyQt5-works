_This is the breakdown of the program from the file path Basic/layout_8/layout_8.py_


# START

This is the design of creating a new demo based on the QStackEdit. the concept goes as follows - 

the first concept is that the new window would be having a layout of two. The first layout is created for the buttons that is assembled in the horizontal position. The next layout is dedicated to the stackedlayout. after that, the two layouts are to be added to the page layout of the app.

_After research, it was found out that if the page layout and the button layout are the same then the stackedlayout would not be presented in the screen._

afterwards, we can add numbers of button widgets which can be used to change the colors of the stackedlayout.

i'll like to point out that the button variables are all the same, there is a word of it but i forgotten it. however, i am both confused and surprised that you can code with the same variable in the pyqt5 or perhaps that you don't even know that.
