This is termed as a important and rare ability of the PyQt5 and not many of the modern or old GUI apps often use this type of technology. 


The PyQt5's checkbox is the topic. 

It cannot be aligned. Which means that the setAlignment sucks. 


The PyQt5's checkbox comes up with the ability of printing out the nature of the checkbox activity with numbers. 

Syntax as follows - 

    def show_state(self, s):
        print(s)
        if s == 1:
            print("What are you doing??")


using the following syntax, we can create some interesting features with the GUI that is completely unexpected. 

I did not checked if we could change the text and the name of the checkbox of the GUI yet.


The behavior of the checkbox can be found at the page 45-46 of the GUI tutorial.
