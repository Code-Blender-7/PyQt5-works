This is the notes of the QSlider and the QSpinBox.


The QSlider and the QSpinBox are quite rarely using in the GUI development. 

the QSpinBox is like a numeric entry box where there are Prefix and a suffix. You understand what that really means eventually. 

The QSpinBox on Windows is more readable compared to the other OS systems. Still, the readability also makes it be a kind of NOT so professional.

The QSlider is a complete different story. It starts off by saying that it is mainly a slider widget. That is it. A slider. 


The Slider widget comes with a ton of features that can easily be used and I really love it. 

However the slider on Windows looks awkward. It looks like it is a slider box than a slider circle. Also, the slider box extends to the edge of the border of the window which makes it very weird to interact. The Slider widget on Linux and macOS are quite good.
