# Volume Measurement GUI



Is a demo app that evaluates the value of a sound in a dialer based on its current position as a value. 

This is a simple app that is also used for research and references. Feel free to use this as a method of managing multiple widgets.


Note that the application may not fully respect the K.I.S.S principle. I just did what I had in mind.
