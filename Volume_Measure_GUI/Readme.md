# Volume Measurement GUI


Is a demo app that evaluates the value of a sound in a dialer based on its current position as a value. 

This is a simple app that is also used for research and references. Feel free to use this as a method of managing multiple widgets.

Note that the application may not fully respect the [K.I.S.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle. I just did what I had in mind.

Thanks to *GeekforGeeks* for the project idea.
