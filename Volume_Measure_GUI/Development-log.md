The QDial is a rotatable widget that can be spinned with the mouse. it is a feature just like the QSlider. However, because of the poor UI design, most of the QDail are more of used for the purpose of creating Radio apps or mostly they are used to create DAW plugins if that is possible.

The QDial is analogue which technically is what I don't even understand....


I really found the QDial interesting. I thought that would it be possible to turn the QDial into a compass that shows which is north or south based on the position of the dial.

However the dial is better used of the purpose of measuring the volume by the help of the numbers.

I learned the trick that not using the setCentralWidget is a good idea to include more widgets.... Thanks to the GeeksforGeeks for the sample.

The first thing that i did was to jog up my memory. I had to find the code ROT13 code that I did maybe 4-6 months ago..

the code included the structure that was used to handle multiple widgets without using the setCentralWidget. I immediately began working on the class and the functions to create the demo.

the whole research and timing took like a hour but the truth is that I am feeling quite numb so yeah... it took a while.
