# Introduction

The PyQt5-works is  a repository where I have relocated all my programs that are created from the Python *Graphical User Interference* (GUI) Library called PyQt5.

Please note that some of the files are created with the help of inspirations and teachings from external tutorials and sources. If there are any such tutorials that are included with the files, I'll mention it if I remember to (ðŸ˜•).


If there are any inquires then open up a issue and I'll make my time to fix it.

### *Prerequiresents*

Most of the python files here (*perhaps except the resource files*) using the PyQt5 Library. Be sure to download the library to avoid package errors and stuff.

Download the PyQt5 by using the command shell~
```
$ pip install pyqt5 
```
or,
```
python install pyqt5
```

Should the program files require additional resources, i be sure to include them as well.

Check out the PyQt5 *[official page](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/#)*. 

### *Additional Notes*

Please be noted that the former name of this repository is called *Designing_mayhems*. I decided that I want to relieve the repository so I turned it into my main PyQt5 activity repo. All the works are located here as like the previous repository name did.
