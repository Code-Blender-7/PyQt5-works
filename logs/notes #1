Every pyqt5 program requires at first 1 instance of the QApplication.

Create a instance of the QApplication by using 
-
app = QApplication(sys.argv)


creating an instance of QWidget using window = QWidget()
remember that all the windows are hidden by default.

wait, all the windows without a parent are hidden.

call app.exec_() to start up the event loop

there is only 1 event loop at any time.



QWidget button is just a blank screen.
USe QPushButton to spawm a button on the screen instead of QWidget
