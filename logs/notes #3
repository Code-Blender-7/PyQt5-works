This is it.

The holy grail is here.

in the section of the book was described about the Signals and the slots of the pyqt5

the setCheckable is a feature that enables the button to be checkable like a box or not. 

the setCheckable is also highlighted


Remember that you can connect the element to multiple slots but the QPushButton is only bound to a single element.

and the project works like magic. 
Though, not many would understand and be able to see when the highlighter is on or off. 

add a checked instance on the slot functions to trigger the boolean of wheither it is triggered or not. 

=============================================================
use the isChecked() function to find out if a button is highlighted or not. 
Remember that to use the isChecked to find out some interesting new behavior in the application.
=============================================================


use setText on any widget to add a new text on them.
use setEnabled(bool) to make them be accessble or not.
