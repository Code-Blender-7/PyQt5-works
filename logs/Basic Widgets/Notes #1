This is the first log of the widget tutorial.

widget can be anything. 
QLabel is basically a label that has text inside of it. 

use this syntax -

font = widget.font()
font.setPointSize(30)

widget.setFont(font)


to appoint and change the font size of the following label.

well, it's a gold mine to me. 

use the widget.setAlignment(Qt.AlignHCenter | Qt.AlignVCenter
) to set the following widget on the center.


URGENT - 
Go to the Page 41 of the pdf course and you will see the details of the widget positioning. 

Similarly, a widget is not always a label. Add a pic by using setPixmap(QPixmap("pic name"))

be sure to import QPixmap from PyQt5.QtGui

setScaledContents are a new method used in the program.

if bool==true then the entire imagine will change size with the widget.
otherwise, the image would just be original from the beginning. 

This note was taken from the doc 
- Weirdly, you can also use QLabel to display an image using the .setPixmap()
method. This accepts an pixmap (a pixel array), which you can create by
passing an image filename to QPixmap. In the example files provided with this
book you can find a file otje.jpg which you can display in your window as
follows:
